    "content": "## **Divisions Roil GOP Amid Epstein Files Push**\n\nPartisan strife over the release of Justice Department files connected to Jeffrey Epstein intensified on Capitol Hill. A bipartisan resolution aimed to force disclosure of sensitive records — documents many Republicans, including Trump’s base, have demanded.\n\n---\n\n## **Johnson’s Calculated Move**\n\nSpeaker **Mike Johnson** shocked observers by adjourning the House early, sending lawmakers on their August recess ahead of schedule. This move halted any vote on the resolution and followed a stalemate in the GOP-controlled Rules Committee, where efforts to attach Epstein-related measures stalled. Johnson cited a need to avoid “side shows,” denying direct pressure from Trump but affirming they’re in regular contact.\n\n---\n\n## **Trump Rebuffs, Then Redirects**\n\nWhen pressed on the Epstein files, **Trump** deflected, labeling the matter a **“hoax”** and redirected attention elsewhere. He mentioned the Justice Department was reviewing grand jury transcripts but minimized the existence of any incriminating **“client list”** — instead accusing Democrats of wrongdoing.\n\n---\n\n## **Pressure from the Base and Beyond**\n\nFrustration mounted among Trump’s base and GOP lawmakers like Reps. **Thomas Massie** and **Marjorie Taylor Greene** over the truncated House session. Bipartisan figures, including **Ro Khanna** and Massie, explored tools like discharge petitions and subpoenas for **Ghislaine Maxwell** to compel document release.\n\n---\n\n## **What Comes Next?**\n\nWith Congress now adjourned until September, the Epstein files are on hold legislatively. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice reportedly may seek to unseal grand jury transcripts, and interest is growing in compelling Maxwell’s testimony before Congress via subpoena.\n",
    "excerpt": "Mounting pressure over release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents has sparked friction within the Republican Party. Former President Trump sidestepped Epstein-related inquiries, while House Speaker Mike Johnson abruptly adjourned the chamber, rejecting a planned vote on releasing the files before their summer break.\n\n",
